 Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article. 'FRANK, it flies]' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden flight of a British jet. 'Of course it does,' replied Sir Frank, who patented the first aircraft gas turbine. 'That's what it was bloody well designed to do, wasn't it?' Exactly 50 years ago yesterday, the first British jet made a brief 17-minute flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. To celebrate the event, Mr Eric 'Winkle' Brown, a 72-year-old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle jet, Mr Geoffrey Bone, a 73-year-old engineer, and Mr Charles McClure, a 75-year-old pilot, returned to RAF Cranwell. They are seen in front of a restored Meteor NF 11. Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill-health. The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly: a Heinkel 178 had its maiden flight in August 1939, 21 months before the British aircraft. Correction (published 16th May 1991). THE PICTURE of a Gloster Whittle jet on Page 7 of the issue of Tuesday May 14, was taken at Bournemouth Airport and not at RAF Cranwell as stated in the caption.
