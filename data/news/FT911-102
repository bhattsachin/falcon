 THE Canadian government will seek powers to hold a national referendum or set up a form of extra-parliamentary machinery to approve a new political deal with Quebec and other changes in the country's political structure, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The government said in a Throne Speech during the opening of parliament in Ottawa yesterday that it planned to reveal its proposals for a new constitution this September. A parliamentary commission will consult widely with the provinces and the public on proposals, and aim to report by February 1992. The initiatives seek to calm fears that forthcoming talks with Quebec and the other nine provinces will occur without full public participation.
