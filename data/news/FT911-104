 NEPALESE voters appear to have delivered an upset by voting communist in the capital, Kathmandu, in the nation's first multi-party parliamentary elections in 32 years. Preliminary results suggest the Communist party defeated the centrist Nepali Congress Party in all five Kathmandu constituencies, including the seat contested by Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, leader of the Congress party. He has been prime minister of the coalition cabinet that has ruled Nepal since last year's revolt against the king. Mr Bhattarai ran against Mr Madhan Kumar Mandari, general secretary of the Communist party. Counting began for 29 of the country's 205 parliamentary constituencies yesterday. Twenty one out of the 205 constituencies will hold new elections today after charges of irregularities, ranging from stuffing ballot boxes to dumping ballots in the river. Final results of the election are expected later this week. Observer, Page 18
