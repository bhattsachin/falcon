 BRITISH Royal Marines are believed to have wounded two Iraqi soldiers in an exchange of fire near one of President Saddam Hussein's palaces in northern Iraq. Allied forces sealed off the area, close to the town of Amadiyah, as the atmosphere remained tense. The incident reportedly began when Iraqi troops fired three rounds from the palace across the front of a marine position. The British forces did not return fire then. Almost two hours later, a high-velocity round was fired at the UK position from the same area and the marines replied with a single shot from the post at Ayn Shaykh, close to Amadiyah and inside the allies' safe haven. Five minutes later, two men emerged from a blockhouse on the palace wall and fired 'long bursts' with automatic weapons, a UK military spokesman said. 'Royal Marines returned fire and they believe two Iraqis were hit.' Shortly afterwards, two more shots were fired from the palace. Iraq later issued a statement denying it had been involved in an exchange of fire with marines. In Zhako, several hundred Kurds besieged 50 Iraqi police in the local police station before US troops persuaded the crowd to disperse.
