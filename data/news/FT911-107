 THE Soviet parliament last night again failed to guarantee its citizens the right of free travel abroad, after one of the Supreme Soviet's two houses refused to pass an emigration bill on grounds of expense, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The bill has been two years in preparation, and received its first reading 18 months ago. It will probably come back to the Supreme Soviet on Thursday, when a commission set up to break the impasse is expected to produce a compromise. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister, said yesterday that discussion of the bill was confined to expense and technicalities, not to principles. However, many of those arguing against the bill were from the hardline Soyuz camp. The bill guarantees that Soviet citizens who apply to travel abroad will receive their passports within a month, while those who wish to emigrate will get them in three months. . No Soviet citizen will be denied entry, as many dissidents have in the past.
