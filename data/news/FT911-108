 EUROPEAN broadcasters yesterday rejected compulsory phasing out of the widely-used Pal satellite broadcasting norm in favour of an intermediate high-definition television standard, as interest groups tried to thrash out common agreement on an EC strategy for HDTV, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Yesterday's discussions between satellite operators, broadcasters and electronics groups form a crucial part of the European Commission's two-pronged attempt to forge a 'memorandum of understanding' between industry representatives, and create a new HDTV directive, before the June 3 meeting of European telecommunications ministers. Bilateral talks between the Commission and individual interest groups will continue this week and another meeting of industry representatives has been convened for May 21.
