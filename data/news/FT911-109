 ITALY'S President Francesco Cossiga has withdrawn his support for Mr Giovanni Galloni, the deputy president of the Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura (CSM), the ruling body for the judiciary, in a public row over increasing Mafia violence. In a step bound to trigger a new crisis between the presidency and the legal establishment, Mr Cossiga yesterday revoked Mr Galloni's powers to represent him as constitutional head of the CSM. Mr Cossiga, who as head of state is also head of the CSM, cannot sack Mr Galloni, as he is elected independently by judges and magistrates. The president's unprecedented step, which has come as a shock to judges and politicians alike, follows growing friction with Mr Galloni and the judiciary on the question of organised crime, notably in southern Italy. Gang warfare in the south, especially Calabria, has reached new heights in the past fortnight, with almost daily tit-for-tat murders. The latest clash between the president and the judiciary follows a call by Mr Cossiga last week for special measures to fight crime. Among other suggestions, he spoke out against sending inexperienced young magistrates to the south. 'It is unbelievable that, just because he has passed an exam in Roman law, a young man is able to conduct complex investigations into the Mafia and the drugs trade,' he said. That provoked a quick response from Mr Galloni in the name of judicial independence. 'The young people thrown into the most difficult regions should be thanked and cannot be - I won't say insulted - but repudiated in their functions,' he said.
