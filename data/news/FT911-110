 A man inspects the wreck of a Soviet military vehicle at a former barracks in Forst Zinna, a village near Juterborg in east Germany. In the background is scrap, also left by Soviet troops when they went home. Waste left elsewhere includes used oil and old ammunition. A Berlin official said yesterday that ecological damage left by Soviet troops in east Germany could take billions of marks to clean up although a reliable study had yet to be conducted. Following German unification, the Soviet Union has agreed to withdraw 380,000 soldiers and their 220,000 family members from eastern Germany by the end of 1994. Now, concerns about who pays for cleaning up the ecological damage left behind have increased. The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel claims wastes have been poured on to the ground or buried in military training areas controlled by the Soviets.
