 PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday signed a decree establishing a 'special regime' in key economic sectors. It was presented as offering incentives to workers who raise their output, although Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, last week described the plan in harsher terms. He said it would allow the government to arrest and bring to trial those who went on, or called for, a strike. The independent news agency Interfax reported that the decree allowed increased autonomy in such basic industries as mining, steel and chemical production, transport and energy extraction. It would permit companies to retain 10 per cent of income earned on domestic or foreign markets. The decree appears to be modelled on the agreement with the mineworkers, both in tying extra wages to extra production and in allowing enterprises to distribute profits among the workforce. At the same time, Mr Gorbachev's office has announced a clutch of new, part-time presidential advisers of a moderately liberal (reformist Communist) bent. They include Dr Leonid Abalkin, the economist, who was deputy prime minister and head of economic reform until late last year. The other advisers are Mr Vladimir Kudryavtsev, director of the Institute of State and Law and a key shaper of legislation under Mr Gorbachev; Mr Vladen Martynov, director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, now a fairly radical think tank; Mr Yuri Osipian, a leading physicist, vice president of the Academy of Science and already on the presidential council; and Mr Boris Oleinik, a deputy chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet and a poet.
