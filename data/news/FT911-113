 ITALY'S big banks have responded quickly to Sunday's one percentage point cut in the discount rate to 11.5 per cent by lowering their rates to borrowers and lenders. The move, which has been warmly welcomed by business, should help mitigate some of the inflationary consequences of the indirect tax increases agreed in Saturday's mini-budget. It will also play an important part in lowering the financing costs on Italy's huge government debt, and may help improve the lira's competitiveness following complaints that it is overvalued. The lira fell to L741.95 against the D-Mark yesterday, against Friday's L739.87. Saturday's budget package, which imposed a L30,000 (Pounds 13.70) tax on credit cards and a swingeing increase in the licence on four-wheel drive vehicles, has been condemned as discriminatory by credit card companies and some motor manufacturers.
