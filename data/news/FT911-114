 Finland's new centre-right government is planning to lower social security and pension costs in a move to inject some FM7bn (about Pounds 1bn) into industry in the next financial year which runs from October, writes Enrique Tessieri in Helsinki. The announcement comes shortly after Prime Minister Esko Aho's government announced that it aimed to save FM4bn in next year's budget as part of a general stabilisation package for the country.
