 A BRITISH-FINANCED independent and liberal newspaper which was due to appear today in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia was blocked from publication yesterday when Vejsnik, the republic's largest newspaper group, prevented its contracted printers from having any dealings with the new daily. The move appears to confirm suspicions by foreign investors that the republic remains reluctant to allow genuine competition, despite its rhetoric about wanting to introduce privatisation and the market economy. But the printing ban on Zapad ('West') could also hold wider political implications for Yugoslavia's second largest republic. A Croatian journalist, unconnected with either paper, said Zapad would have broken the Croatian government's overbearing influence over the media 'by telling the truth and by giving its readers a choice'. Another commented: 'The move to block the paper's printing has political overtones. I do not like to say this, but Mr Franjo Tudjman (the president of Croatia) is waging a propaganda war against Serbia. His right-wing government has little patience for any journalists who do not toe the party's political line.' Zapad, intended to have a circulation of more than 100,000, and modelled on Spain's El Pais, is financed by Tricapital, a UK company which has international interests in oil, property and energy, and Zapad Media, a private company based in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. Mr Strock, the director of Zapad Media, retains the majority share, Tricapital has a large minority share, and the remaining 10 per cent is held by the 40 or so journalists. Mr Strock, who was born in Croatia, has lived in the UK for the past 14 years.
