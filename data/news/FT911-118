 SHARES IN London were hit yesterday by fears that the government may keep interest rates at their current levels this week, in spite of growing concern about the seriousness of the recession. Many companies feel that cuts in base rates, now at 12 per cent, will be required if the UK economy is to recover later this year in line with government expectations. Treasury efforts yesterday to cool hopes of an imminent cut in rates preceded a downturn in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed 37.7 lower at 2,486.6. Trading was also affected by weakness on Wall Street - although the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in positive terrority, closing 4.25 up at 2,924.42 after a weak start - and disquiet among investors at the election fever gripping both the main political parties. In spite of government caution on interest rates, there is a growing belief in the City that monetary policy will be eased soon after the weekend, if there is no rate this week. However, Mr Norman Lamont remains worried by lack of evidence that underlying inflation, particularly related to wages, is coming down. Data from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that consumer credit demand remained subdued in the first three months of the year, while the volume of retail sales fell 0.6 per cent compared with the equivalent period last year. On the foreign exchanges, sterling remained firm. In London it rose 1.3 cents to Dollars 1.7320, and improved to DM2.9675 from DM2.9650, gaining further in New York, to Dollars 1.734 and DM2.97295. London money markets continued to discount a rate cut, with the three-month sterling interbank rate quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, against 11 9/16  11 7/16 on Friday.
