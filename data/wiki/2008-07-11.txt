'''Wayne Meyer''' (b. [[July 24]], [[1975]]) is an American professional wrestler, known by his ringname '''Lex Lovett''', who competes in Southeastern independent promotions such as [[Independent Pro Wrestling]] and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated [[NWA Florida]] as well as having toured the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. 

From 2003 to 2006, he and [[Jason Seguine|Buck Quartermain]] formed a tag team in [[Total Non-Stop Action]] and on the independent circuit. He has also briefly appeared in the [[X Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. 

===Early life and career=== 
Wayne Meyer was born near [[Tampa, Florida]]. At the age of 5, he began watching [[WWF Superstars]] and [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] then hosted by [[Gordon Solie]]. It was during this time that he became a fan of [[Ric Flair]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Blackjack Mulligan]] and [[Barry Windham|Barry]] and [[Kendall Windham]]. He drifted from wrestling as a teenager, however his interest returned when he and his college roommate Alex Lovett started watching during the ''"[[Attitude Era]]"'' in the mid-1990s. While at USF, he was a [[cheerleader|male cheerleader]] and later coached the cheerleading team. After graduating from the [[University of South Florida]] with a degree in finance, he worked for [[Raymond James]] in St. Petersburg as a junior analyst and taught business studies as a substitute teacher at [[Chamberlain High School]] in Tampa. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/02/20/Citytimes/Holding_their_own.shtml |title=Holding their own |accessdate= |author=Matus, Ron |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2004-02-20 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

His roommate began wrestling as Alex Yeull Lovett soon after graduating and Meyer soon expressed interest in entering professional wrestling himself. Alex Lovett introduced him to [[Steve Keirn]] at an IPW show and Keirn agreed to train him at his wrestling school. He was originally scheduled to start training in July 1999, however he postponed it after Alex Lovett died while touring [[Lima, Peru]]. 

That November, he began training under Keirn and [[Jimmy Del Ray]] learning wrestling moves, ring psychology, dieting, workout programs and general conduct. Prior to his debut, he chose the name '''Lex Lovett''' in honor of Alex Lovett. At the end of the year, he wrestled his first match teaming with [[Tim Keirn|"Venom" Tim Keirn]] against '''[[The Heavenly Bodies#DeNucci and Nelson|Drunk & Disorderly]]''' ([[Chris Nelson (wrestler)|Chris Nelson]] & [[Vito DeNucci]]). <ref name="Wojcik"> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://alanwojcik.com/archives/id20.html |title=Lex Lovett Part 1 |accessdate= |author=Wojcik, Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2003 |month=December |format= |work= |publisher=AlanWojcik.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

===NWA Florida===
He spent the next several months in the [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] area for promoter Frankie Reyes and later [[Howard Brodie]]'s [[NWA Florida]] territory. He feuded with the stable ''Tampa Clique'', which at the time included [[Pepi Prado]], [[Jason Seguine|Buck Q]], [[Scoot Andrews]] and [[Mike Sullivan (wrestler)|Mike Sullivan]], during his first five months in the promotion. Still in his rookie year, he eventually defeated Pepe Prado for the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] in Tampa on November 14, 2000. Several months later, he was involved in a controversial storyline in the feud between NWA Florida and IPW Hardcore when he accepted a title challenge from former referee Spanky Malone during an NWA Florida supercard at the [[Homer W. Hesterly Armory]] in Tampa on April 24, 2001. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/radio.html#April 28, 2001: |title=NWA Title Change play-by-play and complete supercard coverage |accessdate= |author=Ringside Live |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2001-04-28 |year= |month= |format= |work=([[Podcast]]) |publisher=WrestlingClassics.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> He pinned Malone with an [[Asai Moonsault]] in 56 seconds and was immediately attacked by 6 wrestlers from IPW Hardcore who were sitting at ringside. Lovett was hit by a [[fireball (wrestling)|fireball]] during the attack before the wrestlers were arrested by security. <ref>McNeill, Pat. ''The Tables All Were Broken: McNeill's Take On The End Of Professional Wrestling As We Know It''. Lincoln: iUniverse, 2002. (pg. 164) ISBN 0-595-22404-0</ref> 

After a nine-month reign, he lost the title to Jet Jaguar in [[Ybor City, Florida]] on July 18. Soon after, he participated in the NWA Super Junior Open tournament. Lovett successfully advanced to the tournament finals to face Scoot Andrews and [[Christopher Daniels]] in a three way match. On August 21, he defeated [[Mike Thunder]] for the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] in Tampa. He had faced Thunder while in Texas the previous month and was one of the top contenders when Thunder, despite having a torn ligament, defended the belt in Florida. Lovett was helped due to outside interference by Jason Rumble who attacked him following the match. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.kappapublishing.com/wrestling/pages/wrestlingframe.html |title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated: Wrestling History |accessdate= |author=Pro Wrestling Illustrated |authorlink=Pro Wrestling Illustrated |coauthors= |date= |year=2007 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=PWI-Online.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

Two months later, Lovett defended the title against top junior heavyweights Jet Jaguar, Jimmy Rave, Brandon K and Jason Rumble in a "Fatal Five-Way" match at the NWA 53rd Anniversary show in St. Petersburg on October 13. Losing the title to Jason Rumble, he was later part of an interpromotional match between NWA Florida and Independent Professional Wrestling pitting Team NWA Florida (Lovett, Buck Q, Rod Steel, Chris Nelson & Vito DeNucci) against Team IPW (Scoot Andrews, Mike Sullivan, Jet Jaguar, Chaos and the Shane Brothers). The match was a "[[WarGames match|Wargames]]"-style match and eventually ruled a no-contest. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2001/oct14_nwa-can.html |title=SLAM! Wrestling: Rough night for Canadians at NWA 53rd |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2001-10-14 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=SLAM! Sports |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>
 
His match with Jason Rumble was eventually seen by [[World Wrestling Federation]] officials who were impressed with the match. He was invited to [[Cincinnati]] by [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] where he would be evaluated along with 14 other wrestlers by [[Jim Cornette]], [[Al Snow]], [[Tom Pritchard]], [[Arn Anderson]], [[Scott Levy|Raven]], [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Bill DeMott]]. He and the others worked on matches and promos with six wrestlers receiving contracts with the WWE, although three wrestlers were later released. On December 21, Lovett was given a tryout match against [[Crash Holly]] on [[WWF Jakked]]. <ref name="Wojcik"/>

===IPW Hardcore===
During the next year, Lovett spent five months on the independent circuit and made appearances for promoter [[Bill Behrens]] in the [[Georgia]]-based [[NWA Wildside]], [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[X Wrestling Federation]] and [[Dusty Rhodes]]' Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling. Although scheduled for one appearance, he again impressed XWF officials who invited him to matches against [[Jimmy Snuka, Jr.]] and [[Low Ki]] at a second XWF television taping. 

By the time he returned to Florida, Lovett saw NWA Florida on the verge of folding and decided to contact promoter Ron Neimi to join rival promotion IPW Hardcore. One of the main figures involved in the NWA Florida vs. IPW Hardcore feud, the "old school" Lovett was promoted as a ''"[[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]"'' among the "[[hardcore wrestling|hardcore]]" fans of IPW. He was originally supposed to become the tag team partner of Buck Quartermain but was replaced with [[Steve Madison]] after Quartermain left the promotion. He and Madison teamed together for only a brief time before Lovett turned on him during a tag team match and attacked him. After he and Madison split up, he took on Vito DeNucci as his manager and feuded with Madison and [[Antonio Banks]]. <ref name="Wojcik"/>

===World Japan Pro===
In 2003, Lovett was contacted by Steve Madison and later [[Masao Hattori|Masao "Tiger" Hattori]] offering to participate in a tour with [[Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling|World Japan Pro]]. Lovett accepted and traveled to Japan where he later met with Hattori and [[Riki Choshu]]. During the four-day Magna01 Power Hall Series, he competed under the name Lex Meyer and faced [[Hiroshi Hase]], [[Shiro Koshinaka]] and Riki Choshu & [[Kensuke Sasaki]] in a tag team match. During the II and III series, he wrestled [[Yoji Anjo]] as well as tag team matches with [[Kenzo Suzuki]] against Koshinaka & Choshu and Sasaki against [[Takao Omori]] & [[Koichiro Kimura]]. On July 19, he lost to NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion Scoot Andrews in a three-way match with [[Billy Fives]] in St. Petersburg. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/fl-h.html |title=Florida Heavyweight Title |accessdate= |author= |coauthors= |date= |year=2003 |month= |publisher=Puroresu Dojo }} </ref>

During the Burning Autumn tour, he faced Steve Madison on the first two nights and received high praise from the promotion. Lovett later took on [[Jose Maximo]], [[Katsumi Usuda]], [[Masamitsu Kochi]] and [[Shume Matsuzaki]]. After leaving Japan, he toured the [[People's Republic of China]] with [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] which took place from December 27, 2003 to January 4, 2004. <ref name="Wojcik"/> On the third and last day of the tour, Lovett defeated [[Mike Rapada]] at the Guangzhou Gymnasium with 3,400 in attendance.

===Total Nonstop Action and the independent circuit===
Soon after his return to the United States, Lovett began wrestling for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. He made his PPV debut in a dark match with Rod Steel against [[David Young]] & [[Tony Mamaluke]] on February 5, 2003. Although used as a [[jobber|preliminary wrestler]] during his first stint with the promotion, he eventually formed a tag team with Buck Quartermain and managed by former ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' contestant [[Johnny Fairplay]]. In July 2004, he faced [[Jeff Jarrett]] for the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/08/01/565733.html |title=SLAM!

Wrestling |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

Later that year, Lovett defeated Scoot Andrews for the [[NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship]] on October 9, 2004. Lovett would face his tag team partner, substituting for an injured [[Roderick Strong]], in a match for the title at NWA Florida's supercard ''Rage in the Cage 7'' on February 26, 2005. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://prowrestlingdaily.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=412 |title=NWA FL (2/26): Rage in the Cage 7! |accessdate= |author=Wojcik, Alan J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-02-28 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Prowrestlingdaily.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060511110630/http://prowrestlingdaily.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=412 |archivedate=2006-05-11 |quote= }} </ref>

He and Quartermain continued to appear in dark matches on TNA's weekly PPV's losing to '''[[Phi Delta Slam]]''' ([[Big Tilly]] & [[Bruno Sassi]]) at [[TNA Against All Odds]], '''The Naturals''' ([[Chris Candido]] & [[Andy Douglas]]) at [[TNA Destination X]] <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=65 |title=TNA Destination X Results 03/13/05 |accessdate= |author=Schultz, Chris |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-03-13 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=TNAwrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> and '''3 Live Kru''' ([[Ron Killings]] & [[Konnan]]) a three-way match with The Naturals at [[TNA Lockdown]] on April 21, 2005. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/tna/lockdown.html |title=TNA Lockdown |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.angrymarks.com/news/View.php?ArticleID=324 |title=04/24/05: TNA Lockdown Results |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-04-24 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=AngryMarks.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> On May 27, he and David Young lost to The Naturals at TNA Impact. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/tv_reports/32390 |title=411's NWA TNA Impact Report 5.27.05 |accessdate= |author=Csonka, Larry |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2005-05-27 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=411mania.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

On June 10, Lovett put his title on the line against [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[A.J. Styles]] at the main event of the Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/06/07/1075358.html |title=SLAM!

Sports |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> Although Lovett came close to victory managing to use his signature move, the "Lex Buster", Styles was able to kick out and pinned Lovett with his own finishing move, the "Styles Clash" for the win. After the match, Lovett addressed the fans thanking them for their support and officially announced his retirement. 

In August 2005, he appeared in the corner of Buck Quartermain in his match against [[Ray Lloyd|Glacier]] at a Coastal Championship Wrestling event. This match was to decide the number one contender for the CCW heavyweight title. The next month, he faced Quartermain in a four-way match with [[Mike Sullivan (wrestler)|Mike Sullivan]] and [[Bruce Steel]] at an IPW Hardcore event on September 17. 

Officially coming out of retirement, Lovett appeared on the [[TNA Impact#Spike TV era|first episode]] of [[TNA Impact]] and lost to [[Monty Brown|"The Alpha Male" Monty Brown]] on October 1. He and Quartermain made their return to TNA losing to The Naturals on October 29. They continued to appear in a part time capacity on TNA Impact during the next year losing to [[Team 3-D]] on January 7 and the [[New Age Outlaws|James Gang]] on January 21, 2006. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/info/quickresults/impact/results/2006.html |title=Quick Results Archive: Weekly PPV's - 2006 |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2006 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=TNAwrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>; they also lost to The Naturals at an Elite Wrestling Entertainment event that same night. He and Quartermain made only infrequent appearances throughout the next few months. Lovett, who was not under contract to TNA, made several inquires into whether he was going to be used in the future in order to quit his full-time job. When he received no response for the promotion, Lovett finally gave his notice in March 2006. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.wrestling101.com/101/newsitem/2706/ |title=TNA: Impact Rating & Lex Lovett Gives Notice |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-04-22 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Wrestling101.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

===Recent years===
On April 1, Lovett beat Vito Denucci with manager [[Bill Alfonso]] via disqualification at a show for Elite Wrestling Entertainment in [[Brandon, Florida]]. Later that night, he joined Buck Quartermain, Erick Stevens and Steve Madison in the main event losing to Mike Sullivan, Shawn Murphy and '''The New Heavenly Bodies''' (Chris Nelson & Vito Denucci) in the "Captain's Fall" elimination match. <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=25566 |title=Newsline, 04/05/2006 |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-04-05 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=1wrestling.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>

In May, he made a one-time appearance in the WWE developmental territory [[Deep South Wrestling]] teaming with [[Mike Shane|Gymini Jake]] in the DSW Tag Team Championship tournament. Defeating [[Eric Perez]] & [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] in the opening rounds, they advanced to the finals where they lost to '''High Impact''' ([[Mike Taylor (wrestler)|Mike Taylor]] and [[Tony Stradlin|Tony Santarelli]]). <ref> {{tlx|cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ga/dsw/dsw-t.html |title=Deep South Wrestling Tag Team Title |accessdate=|date= |year=2003 |month= |publisher=Puroresu Dojo}} </ref>

Educated at Haileybury College, Sandhurst and the Courtauld Institue. Became Director of the Barbican Art Gallery and the founder of Artangel. An acclaimed expert on the Medieaval Russian Fur Trade.
Took was sentenced in February 2008 to spend four and a half years of an indeterminate prison sentence for 18 crimes of child abuse.
As reported in the Spectator Roger Took boasted on internet chat rooms of 'observing' a five year old Cambodian child cowering naked and crying in a corner. She is so frightened she urinates. One of the men hit her repeatedly. The others laugh. Another man picks her up and throws her face down on the bed. Then the men rape her. She dies soon afterwards of atrocious injuries.
Took was arrested in April 2007 charged with molesting two of his step granddaughters and the possession of 260 photographs, including 102 level 5's, which mean they contain images of children being tortured or penetrated, including by animals. One photograph showed a penis entering the vagina of a baby. Many images showed small children shackled to chairs or bars, in obvious pain. Also taken by the police from Roger Took's laptop were 742 chat logs of a sexual nature relating to children adding up to 1,500 pages.
Judge Blaksell deemed Took to be enough of a danger to the public to give him an indeterminate sentence. Took is now appealing. He will be eligible for parole in three and a half years.
Took's wife of 25 years Pat Cleary has decided to talk to the Spectator and Radio 4 Women's Hour because the case has been so little reported by the media.

HIDDEN MECHANISM. Once installed, the playing mechanism is completely hidden from view. The note solenoids and their associated electronics reside within a cutout in the keybed. Underneath the keybed, only the note solenoid mounting rail is visible. 
 The playing mechanism is completely hidden from view 
 CONVENTIONAL TRAPWORK. The hidden mechanism allows the use of conventional trapwork in a reproducing piano for the first time. Pianos equipped with the LX exhibit the same "look and feel" underneath as conventional grand pianos, making use of the lever arrangement that has been universal in piano construction for well over 100 years. Such trapwork is extremely robust and is free from the problems that arise from the unusual levers required by other playing mechanisms, such as loss of the sostenuto pedal function and the need for frequent service to keep the sustaining pedal in adjustment. 

PROPORTIONAL PEDALING. The new LX uses full proportional pedaling. With 256 pedal positions, 100 pedal samples/second, and high-bandwidth closed-loop control, the dampers are raised to their full height and their motion is closely controlled at every instant in time. This reproduces the subtlest and most delicate of pedal effects. Other playing mechanisms use simple "on-off" pedaling, which destroys the pedal shadings that make fine piano playing so satisfying.

HIGH RESOLUTION. The new LX has 1020 dynamic levels for each note with a keyboard samples rate of 800 samples per second, standards that emerged after many years of experimentation and study. These standards, combined with high-resolution control of the note solenoids, yield a degree of articulation and subtlety beyond the reach of other mechanisms.


  
The sustain solenoid remains cool even when the piano is played for extended periods  
 
 

SUPERB MUSICALITY. The combination of proportional pedaling and high-resolution control yields musical results that are head and shoulders above what the competition can do. Words do not do justice to the performance. You have to hear it for yourself.
 

REINFORCED KEYBED. The new LX solves the problem of keybed integrity that comes about from the need to cut the keybed to allow the note solenoids access to the keys. Conventional playing mechanisms do not attempt to remedy the loss of support that ensues, with the consequence that the regulation of the piano action can come and go with the weather. In contrast, the mounting rail of the LX is a rigid steel structure that is attached to the keybed across its width, thereby restoring the structural integrity that was present before installation.

LARGE LIBRARY. The LX plays every CD ever made for reproducing pianos (except for encrypted CDs, which by law cannot be played).


  
The note driver boards use the latest 
advances in high technology electronics 
 
ROBUST DESIGN. The new LX was designed over the past three years and thus takes advantage of recent advances in high-tech electronics, yielding a compact and robust design. It will give many years of pleasure without service or calibration.

Beef & Boards Dinner Theatre is a historic, year-round dinner theatre in Indianapolis, Indiana, offering Broadway shows and employing members of the Actors’ Equity Association.
Seasons typically consist of a straight play, followed by six Broadway shows and ending the year with A Beef & Boards Christmas, the theatre’s annual original holiday variety show. Several concerts are also offered throughout the season, as are special one-hour Live Theatre for Kids performances presented by the theatre’s Pyramid Players.
A buffet dinner, famous for its roast beef, precedes all shows with the exception of the Live Theatre for Kids performances.
The theatre seats approximately 450. More than 4 million people have seen a show at Beef & Boards Dinner Theatre.
=== History ===
Located on the northwest side of Indianapolis, Beef & Boards was one of five dinner theatres built from a chain designed by J. Scott Talbott, a Louisville contractor, with the other locations in Kentucky and Ohio. The name simply stemmed from what was offered: the beef served and the boards – or stage – for performances.
The Indianapolis theatre is located in College Park, near The Pyramids office complex, and opened on March 2, 1973 with the show “Tom Jones.” Today, it is the only remaining theatre from the original chain.
=== Casting a show ===
B&B employs both Equity and non-Equity actors from across the United States. Actors’ Equity Association is the only union for professional actors in the legitimate theatre. 
A new cast selected for each show. 
Actors are found through auditions that take place locally, as well as in Chicago, Memphis and New York City.
=== Entertainment ===
Dozens of stars graced the stage in the local theatre’s early years, including Mamie Vandoren in “How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” (1976), Don Ameche in “Never Get Smart With An Angel” (1977), Ann Miller in “Cactus Flower,” Myrna Loy in “Relatively Speaking” and Adam West in “Hot Shot” (all in 1978), Jerry Mathers in “So Long Stanley” (1979), Cesar Romero in “A Dash Of Spirits” and Tab Hunter in “Chapter 2” (both in 1980).
In 1982, Tina Turner performed at Beef & Boards, just two years shy of her comeback album, Private Dancer.
Other stars who have performed at Beef & Boards include: B.B. King, The Smothers Brothers, Waylon Flowers & Madam, Ricky Nelson, Jan & Dean, Pearl Bailey, Carol Channing, Ray Charles, Rosemary Clooney, Sid Caesar, Chubby Checker, Mickey Gilley, Tony Bennett, Phyllis Diller Helen Reddy, Sha Na Na, Bobby Vinton, Frankie Valli, The Temptations, Three Dog Night, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Donny and Marie Osmond, The Righteous Brothers, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and Lovin’ Spoonful.
=== Religious Services Offered ===
The theatre also opens its doors each Sunday morning to host a local interfaith, nondenominational outreach program for three contemporary religious services before the afternoon matinee and evening performances.

The Bam Bam Amphitheaters are large erosional ravines found in Wonga-Wongue Presidential Reserve in western Gabon.  Although they are referred to as "cirques," they are unrelated to the glacial cirques of high latitudes and mountains.  In Gabon, they are east-facing slopes cut into the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene sandstones that dip westward beneath the Atlantic Ocean.  Because the sandstones are higher and drier than the surrounding coastal plain, they are covered with grasslands rather than the prevailing tropical rain forest.  As the sandstones are locally intensely colored, and because the steep slopes tend to be barren, the "cirques" locally appear to be "badlands" similar to those of the American West.

The Ghana India Kofi Annan Centre for Excellence Advanced Information Technology Institute (AITI-KACE) organized a programming competition for secondary schools in the Volta and Central regions. The programming competition, dubbed i2CAP-â€˜I Too Can Programmeâ€™, is in its second year. AITI-KACE organizes the competition as part of its drive to cultivate Ghanaian IT expertise in all ages. Fourteen (14) senior secondary schools were invited .

The judges were very impressed with the general performance. Nana Yaw Asare Adu, '''Oswald Baidoo''', Charles Otoo, Jnr and Oppong-Quayson from Mfantsipim School, Cape Coast, won this year's competition. The team from St. Augustineâ€™s College, also from Cape Coast, placed second.

Students from non-participating schools, PRESEC, Legon and Ashesi University College, presented their software innovations to the general student audience.

The winning team from the first competition in 2004 came from Chemu Secondary School, Accra.

The GhanaThink Foundation supported this year's event with a cash donation of GHC2 000 000.

== Aciid Elite ==

{{#switch:decline|accept={{afc a}}|mm={{afc mm}}|#default={{afc r}}}}


It has recently come to light that bebo is no longer controlled by the high paid workers in LA but is now controlled by a secret cult who call them self the Aciid Elite. Together the eight (this is not confirmed yet) use secret dark magic methods to control bebo, with one member of the cult having 109092 love, a figure which is impossible to attain by a normal human. Through a secret source we can now tell you the members code names as follows: Pancy, Pissdale, FattyMattY, sheleatyourballs, thefakeman, Sucker, AntiOxidants and Blowmaster. All the secret work takes place in the "fags lounge" the location is unknown. They use secret terms such as T-T and qwned to which there is controversy as to the true meaning.

In 2007, the agency sold a controlling interest to the [[Intermark Group]] to form '''MSP Intermark'''.


'''Bob Sproul''' (born February 1947), grandson of [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], has worked in the advertising business for almost thirty years.

From 1994-1996, Mark worked as Account Supervisor at [[OmniCom]]. It was here that Mark experienced a big shift into direct response marketing and learned about the relationship between PR, direct response marketing, and advertising as well as how to correctly generate results. After gaining consulting and supervising experience, Mark moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1996 where he became the Director of Strategy & Planning at [[ClearInk]]. His reputation within the company grew as he won businesses with his innovative pitches. He won clients like [[PeopleSoft]], [[Maxis]] ([[SimCity]] computer game), [[Ascend Communications]], [[Oracle]], [[Siebel Systems]], [[Tibco]], Asera, and others. During this period, Mark learned how to think through the adoption cycle, budget waste, opportunity cost, tactics vs. selling, solo vs. team approaches, David vs. Goliath issues, and most importantly, how to take companies public.

==='''Notable Campaigns'''===

'''MSP Intermark''' developed a new program called '''Now@Boise'''. The business proposition was simple, buy direct and save. '''Boise''' put a $500 million business at risk on these findings and recommendations, but '''MSP Intermark''' was right. Within the first 90 days, all lost merchant sales ere placed with direct sales. Launch deliverables included swatch books, an e-commerce we site, a teaser DM, and other sales support materials.<ref name=gdusa>http://www.gdusa.com/issue_2004/10_oct/feature/feat_02.php</ref>

In these past years, he also managed to obtain a Masters in Business Administration with specialisation in Technology Management from the Grenoble Business School in France where he graduated with distinction.
 
Dr Dingli has been working in the Nationalist Party for these past sixteen years. When he was just eleven year old, he started volunteering in the various organisations of the Party. At the age of fifteen, he was elected for the first time in the PN sectional committee in Valletta where he took care of the Youth section. On his return from the UK , he once again offered his services to the committee where he was elected as vice president and after a few months as President of the PN Valletta sectional committee. In 2005, he contested the Valletta Local Council elections where he was elected as a councillor of the city. In his portfolio, one finds youth, education, the social aspect and work. In these past years as a councillor, he coordinated a large number of projects, the biggest amongst these being the setting up and coordination of the Valletta Community Network (the network of organisations working in Valletta in the social dimension). The project served as a catalyst to speed up the creation, by central government, of the first community centre in Valletta . 
 
Dr Dingli is a hardworking young man always ready to help others; he is a very dynamic person and full of energy. He believes that his country offered him a lot; free educational and health services of the highest quality and an environment rich in fundamental values which made him what he is today. This formation was crucial for him since it opened a myriad of opportunities abroad. Opportunities which he took, and managed to make a success out of them! Now, he believes that the time has come for him to offer his service to the nation. His believes are targeted at achieving the common good and directed by Christian-Democratic principles and values.
