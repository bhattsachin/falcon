===About===
The Koffler Centre of the Arts is a broad-based cultural institution that was established in 1977 by Murray and Marvelle Koffler.  It is in the area of Toronto known as North York, located within the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre.  The Koffler teaches dance, music, and visual arts; presents exhibitions of cutting-edge contemporary Canadian art, and is home to the Helen and Stan Vine Canadian Jewish Book Awards, the Annual Jewish Book Fair, the Koffler Chamber Orchestra, and the Stars of the 21st Century Gala.  It presents concerts, film screenings, poetry, spoken word, comedy, and discussions on world issues through the lens of culture.  Rooted in the Jewish community of Toronto, one of the most vibrant in the world, the Koffler specializes in an interdisciplinary mix of programs that brings artists and the community together.  In 2008, the Koffler Centre of the Arts was incorporated for charitable status in Canada.  It is an agency of the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto and part of one of the most ambitious not-for-profit building projects in Canada.  Its present campus, set into an extensive ravine along the Don River, is undergoing a major expansion of which the Koffler is a part.

'''The Butterfly Hunter''' is the (as yet) unpublished debut [[novel]] by [[Birmingham]]-based [[British]] writer [[Dr. Max Malik]], which has drawn comparisons with [[Salman Rushdie]]'s controversial work  [[The Satanic Verses]]. '''The Butterfly Hunter''' was completed in 2008, and submitted by the [[author]] to the '''Muslim Writers Awards''', in 2008, as an entry in the [[Novel]] category. The author was winner of the the '''Muslim Writer of the Year Award''' in 2007, and the organisers of the Awards project described his 2008 submission as "one of the best" received. '''The Butterfly Hunter''' was a shortlisted nominee in the [[Novel]] category of the '''Muslim Writers Awards''' in 2008, along with four other works. However, the book was never submitted to the independent judging panel tasked with adjudicating competition entries.

This omission of '''The Butterfly Hunter''' from the judging process has caused much public controversy. The author has claimed that the novel was censored by the '''Muslim Writers Awards''' due to it's controversial content. However, the organisers of the Awards have strenuously denied the accusation, and have insisted that the matter is under investigation. The organisers have also stated that the omission is likely to have been an oversight, although this claim has met with some public cynicism.

The narrative centres around two British protagonists, Jimmy and Jessica, who become involved in a terrorist plot and are recruited by extremists and become suicide bombers. The novel includes several controversial characters and plot-lines, including sexual abuse of children by a [[Mosque]] teacher and a [[bisexual]] [[Imam]] who habitually hires [[rent boys]].

Despite the controversy, and his belief that the organisers of the Muslim Writers Awards found his work "unpalatable", [[Dr. Max Malik]] has insisted that the book should not be regarded as "the second coming of [[The Satanic Verses]]", as he believes that the novel is "neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual."

purpinDICKular is an amish band hailing from Afghanistan. Consisting of four members, Bonnkee (lead vocals), Brick (drummer), Jane (lead guitarist, back up vocals) and Mohammed (rhythm guitar), their K-Pop, Children and Death Metal style will keep you dancing all night long. They have incredible skills musically and mentally, and have also taken on the challenge to compete in the 2008 Olympic Games.

===History===
The group formed on Thursday 12th of June 2008. After the young men had a sudden urge to start screaming like Oliver Sykes whilst mimicing people, they found that the musical connection held between the four was to intense to let die. The bus ride home with Bonnkee, Jane and Mohammed discovered that their true fate lied with there newly found talents. They knew, from that day, they had to start a band. Thus, purpinDICKular was born. Later on, the band recruited Brick after suffering from many dramas of breaking up, before even starting.

===The Dick Was For You Gerard===
The band's first album ever,''The Dick Was For You Gerard'', is being created as we speak. The song list including:<br>
1. Crazy 'Bout the Amish<br>
2. Heaven On Wheels<br>
3. Homoerectis<br>
4. Oprah Hating Dwarf<br>
5. My Pet Mushroom<br>
6. The Dick Was For You Gerard<br>
7. Get Your Own Shotgun!<br>
8. My Favourite (World's Best Mutant)<br>
9. Bible Camp Days<br>
10. High on Christ<br>
11. My Cat Has Herpes<br>
12. The Magical Land Of Vegas<br>
The band are thrilled to be releasing there first album, but have yet to determine the album artwork.

===The Crew===
The purpinDICKular crew, have a small, but magnificent family. The selected few chosen to be apart have been carefully considered, and has so far come with the best results. <br>
Manager - Giandrianne<br>
Medic - Proffessor Doctor Pay-Leanne-Toe-Low-Just Anne-Ass-Is-Stevie-Oli-Just Health Care Kid or Tara<br>
Groupie - Sir Cumalot of Assex<br>
Tour bus driver - Joe

===Influences===
Many of the band mates same similar influences, as they all discovered the magical things that occur when talking about stamp collecting during Colonel Merman's classes. They adore anything with a decent beat (James Blunt, J Gale Kilgore, etc) and have even had influences from multiple trolleys they have saved during Bonnkee's, Jane's and Mohammed's monthly hike.

Corbit is a student and magestic being manifested in Wilmington, North Carolina. He is generally supreme in every way and has found his way into the hearts of many with his notably exciting behavior and impulsive demeanor.

His accomplishments are too numerous to express.

In conclusion, Corbit is better than you, better than me, and probably better than any human being alive.

==Craig Wright (Music Historian)==

Craig Wright


Specialization: music history.

Bio: Studied piano and music history at the Eastman School of Music (1962-1966) and went on to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. in musicology at Harvard (1966-1972). While at Harvard he attended numerous Red Sox games, played chess with pianist Robert Levin, and, as a teaching assistant, taught composer John Adams—all survived the experience. After a pleasant year teaching at the University of Kentucky in Lexington (1972-1973), Wright moved to Yale, serving as chair of the Department of Music from 1986-1992 and becoming the Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Music in 2006. At the undergraduate level he teaches a basic music appreciation course (one of Yale’s largest) and the music history course required of majors in medieval and Renaissance music. Similarly, his graduate courses tend to concentrate on early music, specifically on composers diverse as Leoninus, Dufay, Josquin, and Bach, as well as early chant and liturgy. Recently, he has changed the focus of his professional research from early music to that of Mozart.

Wright’s writing in music history began with a rigorously primary-source approach—the first-hand study in situ of the music manuscripts and archival documents of Western Europe as they pertain to early music. In the course of time he has expanded his view to a broadly interdisciplinary one, as the title of his most recent book suggests: The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology and Music. His interests have also extended chronologically, and his publications now range from studies of the music of Leoninus (died ca. 1200) to Bach. He is one of the few individuals to be awarded the Dent medal (RMA), the Einstein prize (AMS), and the Kinkeldey award (AMS). He also has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and an NEH Fellowship. In 2004 Wright was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago. He especially enjoys playing tennis and traveling around Europe.

Craig Wright is generally recognised as one of the world's leading experts on early Renaissance Music, and particularly of Guillaume Dufay.

The term object-based file system refers to an architectural blueprint for distributed file systems. An object-based file system splits file metadata (such as the filename, its size and access times) from file data and stores them on different servers. File metadata is stored on metadata servers, the file data is split into so-called ''objects'' and stored on object storage servers. The file system client employs metadata and object storage servers to present a full file system abstraction to the users.

The object-based file system architecture has several advantages:
* The file system client accesses file content directly via object storage servers. Metadata servers are only contacted once when the file is opened, thereby eliminating the metadata bottleneck of block-based distributed file systems.
* The size of these objects can usually be configured on per-file basis. This allows the stripe width to be adapted to the access properties of an individual file when the objects of a file are striped across multiple object storage servers.

File systems that follow an object-based architecture include [[Lustre_(file_system)|Lustre]] and [[XtreemFS]].

Stainsby House at Smalley was the home of the Sitwell family. It was bought by Edward Sacheverell Wilmot Sitwell in 1785. His descendant, Robert Sacheverell Wilmot Sitwell, who was a barrister and MP, lived there in Victorian times. The house then changed owner ship various times and was even a poultry farm eventually it was used as a boys school in 1936. The school eventually closed and the house became derelict and deterioted over the course of the next few years. The House was then bought by a one Robert Morley who wanted to demolish the house and create a spanish type villa. Work started on the house in 1971 and was completed by March of 1973. The new house which went by the nickname 'Hollywood Haceinda' was built and took its predecesors name Stainsby House. The house was used in the tv version of the book The lives and loves of the She devil. The House was again left empty when purchased by a Hong Kong business man who furnished the house but never actually resided at the property. The house once again was left derelict until local business men, The Sandhu Family brought the property, the family were known for regeneration of a local area where they own businesses and were awarded the honour of having a street named after them coincidentally named 'Sandhu Street'. The Family have now made various changes to the property and still reside there. The house was used again for several television commmercials and a national magazine advertsement for Mercedes Benz. The house is a remarkable piece of art and was made with the intention of having no corners, the house is equipped with a kidney shape swimming pool and sauna facilties. The house will promanantly feature in a Bollywood film depicting the rags to riches story of the Sandhu Family. Pre production and casting of the film started  in Summer 2008 and filming will commence in spring of 2009.

It is licensed to offer open and closed-end mutual funds in both equity and fixed income asset classes, and has rapidly established a strong presence as a pioneer in asset management. BMA Funds launched Pakistan’s first ever open end off-shore fund, the BMA Pakistan Opportunities Fund, and recently launched the country’s first capital guaranteed fund, the BMA Principal Guaranteed Fund (BPGF).

'''HISTORY OF BMA capital management'''
BMA Capital's genesis - BMA Capital was established in 1992 with the intent of becoming the first professionally managed brokerage house and corporate finance and advisory firm in Pakistan. Although Pakistan's financial markets were still in the process of being liberalized, these were still early days for our capital markets. Indeed, BMA was formed at a time when much of the financial community was shy of even walking into the Stock Exchange.
BMA was conceived and created by unconventional people who refused to accept the "status quo" and had a vision and commitment to be market leaders.  The firm believes that the key to BMA's success and reputation has been driven by its philosophy of establishing long term relationships with clients and a focus on our core businesses. Through a strong belief in nurturing local talent, focusing on quality of service, and a customer-driven corporate culture, BMA has emerged as a leading firm in Pakistan's capital markets today and is poised for growth.
Existing Businesses - BMA currently has six core areas of business which include, Capital Markets, Corporate Finance & Advisory, Asset Management, BMA Trade, Private Equity and Research.  The firm offers its services to a large and diversified group of clients including top financial institutions, local business groups, multinationals, high net worth clients and the Government of Pakistan.  BMA has since inception ranked as one of the top three Pakistani brokers in equities, money markets and foreign exchange.
The firm has enjoyed a high degree of credibility with international fund managers investing in Pakistan from the outset as well.  The firm's corporate financing activities include financial and privatization advisory work, capital raising and M&A's (mergers and acquisitions).  In 1994, BMA reinforced its credentials through a technical collaboration agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), one of the world's top investment banks, to act as their domestic partner for all investment banking transactions in Pakistan.
Following this significant milestone, BMA had the distinction of being  the  lead domestic advisor in landmark transactions in Pakistan's capital markets, including the sale of  10% of Pakistan Telecom Vouchers raising a total of US$898 million for the Government of Pakistan and Government's strategic stake sale of Kot Addu Power Company for a total valuation of nearly US$1.6 billion.

The '''Lewis College (TLC)''' had its beginning in 1999 heralding the coming of the new millenium. At this time, world-renown Filipina industrialist, philanthropist and socio-civic leader, Atty. Loida Nicolas Lewis was divinely inspired to impart a legacy to her kababayans that will generate transformation and uplift the lives of families and their communities. When the sale of Annunciation College property was brought to Mrs. Lewis' attention, she then decided this was it.

The proper geographical name of the bay is possessive, though modern use has erroneously dropped the "apostrophe s".  See the 1908 topo chart here: <ref>http://www.davidrumsey.com/detail?id=1-1-31117-1151048</ref> If the primary article cannot be renamed, at least there should be a redirect from the possessive wording. Thanks!
